# shadcn/ui portfolio

A basic portfolio website built using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), primarily to explore how to build simple applications with it.

## Why

shadcn/ui is a very popular UI library (if not the most popular)

## Goals

- See how shadcn/ui works when you go off the beaten path a bit, such as:
  - Typography for blog posts
  - Main header / navigation with a logo
- Explore how AI can leverage shadcn/ui to write code, as that was one of the main selling points in the shadcn/ui docs.

As I go, I'll document my notes in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the development server
bun --bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Sandbox

My sandbox for exploring and experimenting with various technologies, languages, and tools.

## Getting Started

- Most examples require [Bun](https://bun.sh)

## Creating a new project

The following bash script will create a consistently named folder.

```bash
./create.sh
```

When ran, it will prompt for the directory name, specify it `kebab-case`.
